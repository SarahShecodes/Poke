        Celebrate summer with these irresistible spicy sockeye salmon poke
        bowls! Healthy protein infused with Japanese inspired flavors for a
        delicious gourmet meal. Have you ever tried poke? I fell in love with
        this dish during my first Hawaiian vacation. Itâ€™s actually easy to
        create delicious poke right at home, where you can customize it with all
        your favorite ingredients! I made these spicy sockeye salmon poke bowls
        using the highest quality fish from Luxe Gourmetswhich ships directly to
        you.
