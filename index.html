        Celebrate summer with these irresistible spicy sockeye salmon poke
        bowls! Healthy protein infused with Japanese inspired flavors for a
        delicious gourmet meal. Have you ever tried poke? I fell in love with
        this dish during my first Hawaiian vacation. It’s actually easy to
        create delicious poke right at home, where you can customize it with all
        your favorite ingredients! I made these spicy sockeye salmon poke bowls
        using the highest quality fish from Luxe Gourmetswhich ships directly to
        you.
